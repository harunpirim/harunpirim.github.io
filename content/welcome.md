This is a starter article for the site. It uses **front matter** tags and
inline hashtags so your notes automatically show up in the right topics.

Here are a few tags you can search by: #writing #workflow #web

## How topics work

- The page URL is based on the `topic` (or first tag if no topic is set).
- Every hashtag becomes a topic page under `/topics/<tag>/`.
- Update or add Markdown files under `content/` to publish changes.

```js
// Hashtags inside code blocks like #ignore are ignored.
console.log("Hello!");
```

Lets see if this is working

I am grateful for what I am given. Life is manifested every moment.
